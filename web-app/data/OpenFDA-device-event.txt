I HAD ALL OF THE FLUID REMOVED FROM THE BAND BUT STILL COULDN'T EAT LIKE I FELT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. THIS BECAME WORSE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS, AND THIS YEAR I DECIDED THAT I MAY HAVE FAILED AT THE BAND AND WENT TO A DIFFERENT SURGEON AND JUST WANTED IT REMOVED WITH NOTHING ELSE BEING DONE. I LEARNED FROM SOMEONE WHO WORKED AT THIS OFFICE THAT SHE TOO HAD A DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE BAND TO THE POINT OF HOSPITALIZATION BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO EAT. THEY FOUND THAT HER PROBLEMS WERE SCAR TISSUE BUILT UP UNDER THE BAND TO THE POINT OF CLOSING THE OPENING TO MERELY PIN HOLE SIZED. I DECIDED TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND HAVE THE SLEEVE. DURING A ROUTINE ENDOSCOPY, THEY FOUND THAT MY BAND HAD ERODED INTO MY STOMACH AND THIS WAS WHY I WAS HAVING THE EATING PROBLEM. I HAD IT REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2014 AND THEY FOUND THAT I HAD SEVERAL (7) ADHESIONS THAT HAD TO BE REPAIRED, THE BAND HAD ERODED INTO MY STOMACH IN TWO SEPARATE PLACES AND I TOO HAD THE BUILD UP OF SCAR TISSUE UNDER THE BAND. I HAVE BEEN ALMOST A MONTH RECOVERING AND IT HAS BEEN A VERY ROUGH MONTH. I HAD TO HAVE A DRAIN LEFT IN ME FOR A WEEK TO HELP WITH THE REMOVAL OF INFECTION. NOW I HAVE TO WAIT 6-8 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WILL DO ANOTHER ENDOSCOPY TO MAKE SURE THE ESOPHAGUS AND STOMACH HAVE HEALED TO DO A SLEEVE. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SLEEVE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE DONE. THE RATE OF EROSION IN PATIENTS IS SEVERELY HIGHER THAN WHAT IS BEING REPORTED. THE SCAR TISSUE THAT GROWS UNDER THE BAND LIKE A CALLUS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS EVER EVEN DISCUSSED AND THE FACT THAT IT CANNOT BE SEEN IN AN X-RAY OR AN ENDOSCOPY IS RATHER DANGEROUS. I DID NOT HAVE TYPICAL SIGNS OF AN EROSION OTHER THAN NOT BEING ABLE TO EAT WITHOUT IT BEING A SLIDER FOOD OR HAVE SO MUCH MAYO, GRAVY OR RANCH ADDED THAT IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE. IF I HAD NOT GONE TO HAVE IT COMPLETELY REMOVED THEN WHERE WOULD I BE RIGHT NOW? WOULD I EVEN \"BE\" RIGHT NOW? THIS BAND HAS GOT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET FOR THE SAFETY OF THE CONSUMER. I KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE SURVIVING ON ICE CREAM AND MILKSHAKES ALONE BECAUSE THIS IS ALL THAT WILL GO DOWN. HOW HEALTHY IS THAT FOR SOMEONE? PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE HAVE MORE FATALITIES WITH THIS BAND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.",

HE THEN (ON AN UNKNOWN DATE) OPENED THE 2ND BOTTLE (LEAVING THE DESICCANT IN THE BOTTLE) AND PERFORMED A BLOOD GLUCOSE TEST AT 2:00 PM. THE RESULT WAS 40 MG/DL. HIS WIFE EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS A VERY HOT DAY AND HE WAS HAVING TOUBLE WITH DEHYDRATION. LATER AT APPROX 5:00 PM, HE ATE DINNER. HE TOOK HIS NORMAL INSULIN INJECTION BEFORE DINNER. AT APPROX 6:00 PM HE PERFORMED A BLOOD GLUCOSE TEST AND THE RESULT WAS 300 MG/DL. HE DID NOT FEEL HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE WAS HIGH, BUT RATHER VERY LOW. HE CALLED HIS WIFE AT WORK. HE WAS CRYING AND HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE CHILDREN AND THE HEAT. HE WAS UNABLE TO EAT ICE CREAM FAST ENOUGH TO ELEVATE HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE AND HE WAS DISORIENTATED. HIS WIFE CALLED THE PT'S MOTHER AND ASKED HER TO GO OVER AND SEE IF HE WAS ALL RIGHT. WHEN THE PT'S MOTHER ARRIVED, HE WAS ON THE FLOOR WITH A PILLOW. HE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE CHILDREN AND HE WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT EAT FAST ENOUGH TO STOP THE LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE REACTION. HIS MOTHER CALLED HIS WIFE AT WORK AND EXPLAINED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. HIS WIFE CALLED THE PARAMEDICS WHO TRANSPORTED HIM TO THE HOSP. THE PT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL WAS 40 MG/DL (METER TYPE KNOWN) UPON ARRIVAL AT THE HOSP. THE PT WAS GIVEN ORANGE JUICE, GLUCOSE TABS AND WATER BECAUSE HE WAS DEHYDRATED FROM THE HEAT. HE WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSP 1 HR LATER. HIS WIFE STATED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. HEAT AND STRESS WERE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS. SHE ALSO STATED THAT HIS HEMOGLOBIN A1C TEST WAS A \"NON-DIABETIC\" RESULT (NO SPECIFIC RESULT WAS REPORTED). THE CUSTOMER RETURNED TEST STRIPS WERE EVALUATED ON 9/24/96. ONE OPENED BOTTLE CONTAINING ONE STIRP WITHOUT DESICCANT WAS RETURNED TO CO FOR EVAL. THE TEST RESULT OF THE SINGLE RETURNED STRIP FELL BELOW THE SPECIFICATION FOR BLOOD GLUCOSE ACCURACY. THE PT'S WIFE STATED WHEN SECOND BOTTLE WAS OPENED, THE DESICCANT WAS LEFT INSIDE BOTTLE. HOWEVER, UPON RECEIPT OF RETURNED PRODUCT BY CO, DESICCANT WAS ABSENT. ABSENCE OF DESICCANT FROM RETURNED BOTTLE EXPLAINS THE LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE READING OBTAINED BY CO. RETENTION SAMPLE TEST RESULTS FOR DEVICE MEET SPECS FOR BLOOD GLUCOSE ACCURACY AND PRECISION AND THE NORMAL CONTROL READINGS ARE ALSO WITHIN THE SPECIFIED RANGE. TREND ANALYSIS OF COMPLAINTS SHOWS THIS IS THE FIRST COMPLAINT FOR DEVICE. BASED ON THE EVAL OF RETENTION SAMPLES AND TREND ANALYSIS, RISK OF PRODUCT FAILURE, IN THE FIELD IS LOW. IT IS ALSO NOTED THAT NATURE OF THIS EVENT DOES NOT INDICATE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH PERFORMANCE OF THE TEST STRIPS. IS EVENT OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY THAN STATED IN LABELING? U.

HOWEVER, THE PATIENT NOTED THAT HE HAD BEEN USING THE DAMAGED TEST STRIP VIAL IN QUESTION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. ON AUG. 17, 2007, THE MEDICAL AFFAIR SPEC. CONTACTED THE PATIENT TO OBTAIN/CLARIFY MORE INFO. THE NEXT MONTH, THE PATIENT OBTAINED A READING OF \"151 MG/DL\", TOOK 42 UNITS OF LANTUS AND 16 UNITS OF NOVOLOG, AND HAD A BOWL OF RICE CRISPY AND SOME BLUEBERRY. DURING LUNCH TIME, HE OBTAINED A READING OF \"80 MG/DL\", TOOK 8 UNITS OF NOVOLOG, AND ATE A HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH. DURING DINNERTIME, HE OBTAINED A READING OF \"70 MG/DL\", TOOK 8 UNITS OF NOVOLOG, AND CONSUMED PORK, SAUERKRAUT, AND A POTATO. AT 7:30PM, AFTER HE OBTAINED A READING OF \"118 MG/DL\", HE TOOK 6 UNITS OF LANTUS AND 14 UNITS OF NOVOLOG, AND HAD A BOWL OF ICE CREAM. AT 11PM, THE PATIENT PASSED OUT AND REQUIRED EMERGENCY SERVICE. EMERGENCY SERVICE OBTAINED A GLUCOSE READING OF \"31 MG/DL\", AND THE PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH IV GLUCOSE. THE PATIENT REFUSED TO GO TO ER AFTER HE REGAINED CONSCIOUS. THE PREVIOUS MONTH, THE PATIENT OBTAINED A READING OF \"203 MG/DL\", TOOK 42 UNITS OF LANTUS AND 24 UNITS OF NOVOLOG, AND ATE HIS USUAL BREAKFAST.

THE NEXT DAY, THE PATIENT REPORTED BLOOD GLUCOSE RESULTS OF \"105, 77, AND 204 MG/DL\" WITH A LIFESCAN METER, PERFORMED WITHIN 10 MINS OF EACH OTHER. BASED ON STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY, THE CALCULATED DIFFERENCE OF THESE GLUCOSE RESULTS EXCEEDS THE EXPECTED VALUE OF <=20% AND/OR <= 20 MG/DL. DURING TROUBLESHOOTING, THE CUSTOMER CARE ADVOCATE NOTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS USING THE CORRECT TESTING TECHNIQUE, THE PUNCTURED AREA WAS CLEANED CORRECTLY, THE METER WAS CODED CORRECTLY, THE PATIENT WAS USING AN APPROVED SAMPLE SOURCE, AND THE TEST STRIP VIAL IS DAMAGED. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE THE PATIENT REPORTED HE OBTAINED RELATIVELY HIGH READINGS TWO MONTHS EARLIER, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE ALLEGED DAMAGED TEST STRIP VIAL, ADMINISTERED INSULIN BASED ON HIS READING AND FOOD INTAKE, AND DEVELOPED HYPOGLYCEMIC SYMPTOMS OF UNEXPLAINED SWEATING.

NO OTHER INFO WAS PROVIDED. ON 9/10/96, REP TRIED TO CALL THE CONTACT WHO WAS OUT OF THE OFFICE FOR THE DAY. THE REP WILL CALL THE CONTACT AGAIN ON 9/11/96. IN A CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOLLOW-UP, ADD'L INFO WAS OBTAINED FROM PT'S WIFE. SHE STATED THAT APPROX SIX WEEKS AGO HER HUSBAND WAS USING TEST STRIPS AND OBTAINING LOW READINGS OF 40 AND 50 MG/DL. CUSTOMER HAD REMOVED THE DESICCANT FROM THE FIRST BOTTLE (LEAVING DESICCANT IN THE BOTTLE) AND PERFORMED A BLOOD GLUCOSE TEST AT 2:00 PM. RESULT WAS 40 MG/DL. HIS WIFE EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS A VERY HOT DAY AND HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH DEHYDRATION. LATER AT APPROX 5:00 PM, HE AFTE DINNER. HE TOOK HIS NORMAL INSULIN INJECTION BEFORE DINNER. AT APPROX 6:00 PM HE PERFORMED A BLOOD GLUCOSE TEST AND THE RESULT WAS 300 MG/DL. HE TOOK HIS NORMAL INSULIN INJECTION BEFORE DINNER. AT APPROX 6:00 PM HE PERFORMED A BLOOD GLUCOSE TEST AND THE RESULT WAS 300 MG/DL. HE DID NOT FEEL HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE WAS HIGH, BUT RATHER VERY LOW. HE CALLED HIS WIFE AT WORK. HE WAS CRYING AND HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE CHILDREN AND THE HEAT. HE WAS UNABLE TO EAT ICE CREAM FAST ENOUGH TO ELEVATE HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE AND HE WAS DISORIENTED. HIS WIFE CALLED THE PT'S MOTHER AND ASKED HER TO GO OVER AND SEE IF HE WAS ALL RIGHT. WHEN THE PTS MOTHER ARRIVED, HE WAS ON THE FLOOR WITH A PILLOW. HE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE CHILDREN AND HE WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT EAT ENOUGH TO STOP THE LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE REACTION. HIS MOTHER CALLED HIS WIFE AT WORK AND EXPLAINED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. HIW WIFE CALLED THE PARAMEDICS WHO TRANSPORTED HIM TO THE HOSP. THE PT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL WAS 40MG/DL (METER TYPE KNOWN) UPON ARRIVAL AT THE HOSP. THE PT WAS GIVEN ORANGE JUICE, GLUCOSE TABS AND WATER BECAUSE HE WAS DEHYDRATED FROM THE HEAT. HE WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSP ONE HOUR LATER. HIS WIFE STATED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. HEAT AND STRESS WERE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS. SHE ALSO STATED THAT HIS HEMOGLOBIN A1C TEST WAS A \"NON-DIABETIC\" RESULT (NO SPECIFIC RESULT WAS REPORTED). THE CUSTOMER RETURNED TEST STRIPS WERE EVALUETED ON 9/24/96. ONE OPENED BOTTLE CONTAINING ONE STRIP WITHOUT DESICCANT WAS RETURNED TO CO FOR EVALUATION. THE TEST RESULT OF THE SINGLE RETURNED STRIP FELL BELOW THE SPECIFICATION FOR BLOOD GLUCOSE ACCURACY. PT'S WIFE STATED WHEN SECOND BOTTLE WAS OPENED, THE DESICCANT WAS LEFT INSIDE THE BOTTLE. HOWEVER, UPON RECEIPT OF THE RETURNED PRODUCT BY CO, THE DESICCANT WAS ABSENT. ABSENCE OF DESICCANT FOR RETURNED BOTTLE EXPLAINS LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE READING OBTAINED BY CO.",

THE PATIENT INDICATED THAT HE WAS HOSPITALIZED ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE/TIME FOR KIDNEY FAILURE AND NEEDING A FISTULA. HE WAS NOT IMPLICATING A PUMP ISSUE FOR THE HOSPITALIZATION. DURING THE HOSPITALIZATION, THE PATIENT'S WIFE REPORTEDLY TURN THE PUMP OFF FOR ABOUT A WEEK. WHEN THE PATIENT POWERED THE PUMP BACK ON A DAY EARLIER ON (B)(6) 2012, HE REPORTEDLY FOUND HIS BASAL PROGRAM AS BEING EMPTY. HE THOUGHT HIS BASAL PROGRAM HAD CANCELED. THEREFORE, THE PATIENT CREATED A NEW BASAL PROGRAM BASED ON MEMORY. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW BASAL PROGRAM, THE PATIENT CLAIMED THAT HE SUFFERED A LOW BG LEVEL OF \"49 MG/DL\" AT 6:00 PM ON (B)(6) 2012. AT THAT TIME, THE PATIENT WAS REPORTEDLY UNRESPONSIVE ACCORDING TO HIS WIFE. WHEN THE WIFE THREATENED TO CALL 911, THE PATIENT REPORTEDLY PERKED UP AND WAS ABLE TO CONSUME ORANGE JUICE AND ICE CREAM. BY 8:00 PM HIS BG LEVEL ROSE TO \"87 MG/DL.\" NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS REPORTED BY THE PATIENT. THROUGH TROUBLESHOOTING, THE ANM REPRESENTATIVE FOUND OUT THAT THE PATIENT WAS CURRENTLY USING A \"2-OTHER\" BASAL PROGRAM WITH A TOTAL OF \"27.76 UNITS/DAY.\" THE PUMP'S \"1-WEEKDAY\" BASAL PROGRAM WAS SET TO A TOTAL OF \"12.27 UNITS/DAY.\" THE PATIENT CONFIRMED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN USING THE \"1-WEEKDAY\" SETTING. THE PATIENT CONCLUDED THAT HE MUST HAVE LOOKED AT EITHER PROGRAM 3 OR 4. THE ANM ASSISTED THE PATIENT WITH CHANGING THE BASAL PROGRAM TO \"1-WEEKDAY.\" HE WAS ALSO ADVISED TO CONTACT HIS HEALTH CARE PROVIDER (HCP) TO REVIEW THE PUMP'S SETTINGS FOR ACCURACY. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION: THE PATIENT CLAIMED THAT HE DEVELOPED A LOW BG LEVEL, BECAME UNRESPONSIVE, AND RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM HIS WIFE AFTER HE INCORRECTLY PROGRAMMED THE PUMP'S BASAL PROGRAM. THE PATIENT'S INJURY CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO USE-ERROR CONSIDERING THE PATIENT INCORRECTLY SET UP THE PUMP'S BASAL PROGRAM BASED ON MEMORY.",

AT 12:30 AM ON ORIGINAL DATE, THE PT BECAME LIGHTHEADED AND SHAKY. HE DOES NOT RECALL IF HE WAS STILL AWAKE OR WOKE UP DUE TO THE SYMPTOMS. THE PT ATE ICE CREAM TO RELIEVE THEM AND SOON AFTER CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO REPLACED THE METER AND TEST STRIPS. BECAUSE THE PT HAD NEVER CHANGED THE BATTERY AND HAD NONE TO INSTALL, THE CCA WAS UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE ALLEGED ISSUE.

THE DAY BEFORE, AT 6AM, THE PT OBTAINED A 125MG/DL ON HER METER WITH NO REPORTED SYMPTOMS.

AFTER EATING THE ICE CREAM, THE PT OBTAINED A 181 MG/DL ON HER METER. BECAUSE THE PT STILL HAD SYMPTOMS AFTER EATING THE ICE CREAM, THE PT WAS TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BY AN AMBULANCE. WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL, HER BLOOD GLUCOSE WAS IN THE \"40'S MG/DL\" ON AN UNSPECIFIED HOSPITAL DEVICE AND WAS GIVEN AN IV TO BRING HER BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS UP.

THE REPORTER WAS UNABLE TO SPECIFY IF THE CORRECT TESTING/CLEANING TECHNIQUES WERE USED AT THE TIME OF TESTING. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE THE PT'S LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE SYMPTOMS DID NOT CORRELATE WITH THE 181 MG/DL METER READING.

HE GENERALLY TESTS DURING MEAL TIMES AND AT BEDTIME. THE REPORTER MANAGES THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE WITH ADJUSTED DOSES OF AMARYL BASED ON THE METER READINGS. THE REPORTER DOES NOT GIVE ANY AMARYL IF THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IS LESS THAN \"120 MG/DL.\" THE REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE ALLEGED ISSUE STARTED AT AN UNKNOWN TIME BEFORE THE PATIENT HAD A HYPOGLYCEMIC EVENT ON (B)(6) 2010. THE REPORTER CLAIMED THAT ON (B)(6) 2010, HE HAD TESTED THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE AROUND DINNER TIME AND GOT A METER READING OF AROUND \"116 OR 120\" MG/DL. AROUND 11:00 PM, THE REPORTER TESTED THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE AFTER HAVING EATEN ICE CREAM AND GOT A RESULT OF \"145 MG/DL.\" SHE WAS ASYMPTOMATIC AT THE TIME. BASED ON THE METER READING, THE REPORTER TREATED THE PATIENT WITH AMARYL ACCORDING TO HER MEDICATION REGIMEN. AT AN UNKNOWN TIME BETWEEN 11:00 PM TO 2:00 AM THE NEXT DAY, THE REPORTER CLAIMED THAT THE PATIENT DEVELOPED LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE SYMPTOMS OF BEING CLAMMY AND DISORIENTED. THE REPORTER ALLEGED THAT POSSIBLY THE RESULT OF \"145 MG/DL\" WAS INACCURATE. HE TESTED THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE AT 2:00 AM AND REPORTEDLY GOT A RESULT OF \"171 MG/DL.\" HE CALLED FOR PARAMEDICS. WHEN THE PARAMEDICS ARRIVED, THEY REPORTEDLY TESTED THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE USING AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) METER AND GOT \"29 MG/DL.\" THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE \"171 AND 29 MG/DL\" RESULTS WAS REPORTEDLY LESS THAN 30 MINUTES. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER, THE PARAMEDICS TREATED THE PATIENT WITH A \"SHOT\" TO RAISE HER BLOOD GLUCOSE AND THEN TOOK HER TO A HOSPITAL. THE REPORTER CLAIMED THAT THE HOSPITAL TESTED THE PATIENT'S BLOOD GLUCOSE WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND GOT A RESULT OF \"17 MG/DL.\" THE REPORTER MENTIONED THAT THE PATIENT HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED SINCE THEN AND HAS BEEN RECEIVING TREATMENT TO STABILIZE HER BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE METER, TEST STRIPS, AND CONTROL SOLUTION WERE REPLACED. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION: THE REPORTER CLAIMED THAT THE PATIENT DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS SUGGESTIVE OF SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA, RECEIVED MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND WAS HOSPITALIZED AS A RESULT OF THE ALLEGED ISSUE. THE REPORTER CLAIMED TO HAVE OBTAINED A METER READING THAT DID NOT CORRELATE WITH THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS OR TREATMENT.",

THE MEDICAL AFFAIRS SPECIALIST (MAS) MAILED A LETTER TO THE PATIENT IN MAY 2006, SINCE HE COULD NOT BE CONTACTED BY TELEPHONE ON TWO SEPERATE DAYS.ON AN UNKNOWN DATE/TIME, THE PATIENT ATTEMPTED TO TEST HIMSELF WITH THE REPORTED METER BUT UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO THE METER POWERING OFF DURING USE. AFTER ATTEMPTING TO USE THE METER, THE PATIENT ATE FOOD AND/OR DRANK A BEVERAGE. HE WAS ASYMPTOMATIC AT THE TIME. ON ANOTHER UNKNOWN DATE/TIME, THE PATIENT ENCOUNTERED AN ISSUE WHERE A BLOOD TEST WOULD NOT START ON THE METER. THE METER JUST SHOWED THE \"APPLY SAMPLE\" SYMBOL. AGAIN, THE PATIENT DID NOT HAVE SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, THE PATIENT DID NOT TAKE ANY INTERVENTION AFTER ATTEMPTING TO USE THE METER. THE PATIENT INDICATED THAT IN MAY 2006, HE WAS INVOLVED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. EMERGENCY SERVICES TOOK HIM TO A HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS GIVEN \"IV FLUIDS\" TO STABILIZE HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE PATIENT ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE HAD ICE CREAM. HE WAS ADMITTED IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2 HOURS BEFORE LEAVING AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE. THE PATIENT ALSO INDICATED THAT HE THOUGHT HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE READINGS WERE LOW. THE MAS CORRESPONDED WITH THE CUSTOMER CARE ADVOCATE (CCA) THAT SPOKE TO THE PATIENT DURING THE INITIAL CALL THAT WAS MADE TO LIFESCAN. THE CCA STATED THAT THE PATIENT BELIEVED THE METER'S ISSUES CONTRIBUTED TO THE CAR ACCIDENT. THE CCA WAS ABLE TO RESOLVE THE \"APPLY SAMPLE\" ISSUE DURING TROUBLE-SHOOTING. HOWEVER THE METER, TEST STRIPS, AND CONTROL SOLUTION WERE REPLACED.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO KNOW THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: WHEN DID THE METER ISSUES START, DID THE PATIENT ATTEMPT TO TEST HIMSELF BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE CAR ACCIDENT, AND WHAT BLOOD GLUCOSE READINGS DID EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE HOSPITAL GET. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF MEDICAL TREATMENT THE PATIENT RECEIVED ON THE DAY OF THE EVENT, WHAT THE PATIENT'S MEDICATION/TREATMENT REGIMEN WAS AT THE TIME OF CONCERN, IF THE PATIENT WAS FOLLOWING THE REGIMEN PRIOR TO THE EVENT, AND WHAT MEALS/BEVERAGES DID THE PATIENT HAVE BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION: THE PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO TEST WITH THE REPORTED METER DUE TO THE POWER ISSUE. ALSO, THE PATIENT COULD NOT GET A TEST TO START ON THE METER. THE PATIENT GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT AND WAS TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL WHERE HE RECEIVED \"IV FLUIDS\" TO STABILIZE HIS GLUCOSE.",

THE ENTIRE TIME I SUFFERED FROM CONSTANT PAIN, VOMITING, AND REFLUX. I HAD TO SEE MY SURGEON SEVERAL TIMES TO HAVE THE FLUID COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM MY BAND DUE TO THE INABILITY TO EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING. IN (B)(6) 2014, THE LAST TIME HE REMOVED ALL OF THE FLUID, I WAS SENT FOR TESTING TO SEE IF THERE WAS A \"SLIP\" OF THE BAND. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE WAS A SLIP. I HAD TO HAVE SURGERY TO REMOVE THE BAND OR FIX IT. IT WASN'T UNTIL (B)(6) 2014 THAT I WAS ABLE TO HAVE SURGERY FOR REMOVAL. I ELECTED NOT TO FIX THE SLIP, RATHER I CHOSE TO REMOVE IT DUE TO ENCOUNTERING FOUR YEARS OF COMPLICATIONS. I ELECTED TO CONVERT TO RNY AFTER THE BAND WAS REMOVED. DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH TAKING OUT THE PORT AND MY STOMACH HAVING SEVERE EDEMA, DUE TO THE BAND, THE SURGEON COULD NOT PERFORM RNY SURGERY AT THE SAME TIME. I MUST ADD THAT THE ENTIRE TIME I HAD THE BAND, I BASICALLY WAS ANOREXIC WITHOUT LOSING WEIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS, I WASN'T ABLE TO CONSUME HEALTHY FOOD WITHOUT SEVERE PAIN, FOLLOWED BY VOMITING. IN FACT, AT ONE POINT I LIVED ON ICE CREAM BECAUSE I COULD NOT EAT ANYTHING. EVEN EATING ICE CREAM CAUSED ME TO VOMIT. WITH THE FLUID COMPLETELY REMOVED, I STILL SUFFERED FROM PAIN AND VOMITING. THE BEST DECISION I COULD HAVE MADE WAS TO HAVE THE BAND REMOVED. PAIN, VOMITING, AND REFLUX ARE OBSOLETE NOW. IT'S SCARY TO THINK OF ANY LONGTERM EFFECTS THAT THIS WEIGHT LOSS TOOL COULD HAVE ON ME.",

IF YES, DID ANY PIECE FALL INTO THE PATIENT? WAS THE PIECE RETRIEVED? THE PAD DID NOT MELT COMPLETELY, BUT PIECES CRUMBLED AND BROKE OFF. YES, THEY FELL INTO THE PATIENT/SURGICAL FIELD AND WERE RETRIEVED SAFELY. DOES THE SURGEON ACTIVATE THE DEVICE WITH THE JAWS CLOSED, WITH NO TISSUE BETWEEN THE JAWS? BECAUSE OF THE SURGEONS EXPERIENCE, IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE DEVICE WAS ACTIVATED WITH CLOSED JAWS W/O TISSUE INBETWEEN. ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TWICE IN A ROW AND NEVER HAPPENED IN ANY OF HIS PRECEDING SURGERIES. REGARDING THE HOT INSTRUMENT: THE HARMONIC DEVICES USE ULTRASONIC ENERGY TO CUT AND COAGULATE VIA VIBRATIONS IN THE BLADE AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE BLADE HAS TO HAVE DIRECT CONTACT TO GENERATE HEAT. HOW WAS IT DETERMINED THAT THE FCS9 WAS VERY HOT? AS TOLD BY THE SURGEON, THE DEVICE WAS UNUSUALLY HOT WHEN TOUCHED WITH FINGERS ONLY SECONDS AFTER ACTIVATION. NOT ONLY JAW BUT ALSO THE SHAFT. HOW DOES THE ACCOUNT ASSEMBLY THE HANDPIECE TO THE DEVICE? VERTICALLY, LIKE AN ICE CREAM COME? IS THE BLUE GRIP ASSIST USED? THERE IS NO DETAILED INFORMATION AVAILABLE. CONSIDERING THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SURGEON AND THE NURSES, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THE PIECES WERE ASSEMBLED CORRECTLY (ASSEMBLED VERTICALLY AND BLUE GRIP USED TO TIGHTEN). THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE WARN: AUDIBLE HIGH-PITCHED TONES RESONATING FROM THE BLADE OR HAND PIECE DURING ACTIVATION ARE AN ABNORMAL CONDITION AND AN INDICATOR THAT THE BLADE OR HAND PIECE IS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY. THE TONES MAY BE AN INDICATOR THAT THE HAND PIECE IS BEYOND IT'S USEFUL LIFE OR THAT THE BLADE HAS NOT BEEN ATTACHED PROPERLY, WHICH MAY RESULT IN ABNORMALLY HIGH SHAFT TEMPERATURES AND USER OR PATIENT INJURY. BLOOD AND TISSUE BUILDUP BETWEEN THE BLADE AND SHAFT MAY RESULT IN ABNORMALLY HIGH TEMPERATURES AT THE DISTAL END OF THE SHAFT. TO PREVENT BURN INJURY, REMOVE ANY VISIBLE TISSUE BUILDUP AT THE DISTAL END OF THE SHAFT. TO AVOID USER OR PATIENT INJURY IN THE EVENT THAT ACCIDENTAL ACTIVATION OCCURS, THE INSTRUMENT BLADE, CLAMP ARM, AND DISTAL END OF THE SHAFT SHOULD NOT BE IN CONTACT WITH THE PATIENT, DRAPES, OR FLAMMABLE MATERIALS WHILE NOT IN USE. DURING PROLONGED ACTIVATION IN TISSUE, THE INSTRUMENT BLADE AND CLAMP ARM MAY BECOME HOT. AVOID UNINTENDED CONTACT WITH TISSUE, DRAPES, SURGICAL GOWNS, OR OTHER UNINTENDED SITES AT ALL TIMES. INCIDENTAL AND PROLONGED ACTIVATION AGAINST SOLID SURFACES, SUCH AS BONE, MAY RESULT IN BLADE HEATING AND SUBSEQUENT BLADE FAILURE, AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED.",

SHE ALSO TAKES AN UNSPECIFIED DOSE OF \"LANTUS\" INSULIN AT NIGHT AND \"NOVOLOG\" INSULIN 3 TIMES A DAY (BEFORE BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND AROUND 4:00 PM BEFORE LEAVING WORK). IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE \"NOVOLOG\" REGIMEN IS ON A SLIDING-SCALE. THE PT STATED THAT SHE HAD BEEN GETTING READINGS IN THE \"HIGH 300'S AND 400'S\" MG/DL FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS. ON THE SAME DAY, AT NOONTIME, THE PT OBTAINED A METER READING OF \"348 MG/DL\" WITHOUT ANY SYMPTOMS OF HIGH/LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE. AFTER TESTING WITH THE REPORTED METER, THE PT ADMINISTERED SELF-CARE BY TAKING 10 UNITS OF INSULIN. SHE ATE YOGURT FOR LUNCH. AROUND 4:00PM, THE PT RETESTED HER BLOOD GLUCOSE AGAIN AND GOT \"403 MG/DL.\" SHE HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING SINCE HER LUNCHTIME. AGAIN, THE PT ADMINISTERED SELF-CARE BY TAKING ANOTHER 10 UNITS OF INSULIN. AROUND 5:30-6:00 PM, THE PT ARRIVED AT HOME FEELING SHAKY AND \"ON THE VERGE OF PASSING OUT.\" THE PT EXPLAINED THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH TO TRY AND TEST HER BLOOD GLUCOSE. THE PT TREATED HERSELF BY EATING ICE CREAM AND THEN \"PASSED OUT\" AFTER LYING DOWN TO REST. THE PT DID NOT WAKE UP UNTIL ABOUT AN HOUR LATER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO KNOW THE FOLLOWING INFO: IF THE PT TOOK THE \"NOVOLOG\" INSULIN BASED ON A SLIDING-SCALE AND METER READINGS, IF THE PT DRANK A BEVERAGE DURING THE TIME OF CONCERN, AND WHAT HER NORMAL/EXPECTED BLOOD GLUCOSE READINGS ARE. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO KNOW THE PT'S COMPLETE MEDICATION REGIMEN, IF SHE WAS FOLLOWING THE REGIMEN AS PRESCRIBED, AND IF SHE TESTED HER BLOOD GLUCOSE WHEN SHE WOKE UP . THE PT WAS USING A CORRECT TECHNIQUE FOR TESTING WITH THE REPORTED METER. THE PT WAS OBTAINING BLOOD SAMPLES FROM HER FINGERS AND CLEANING THE PUNCTURE SITES CORRECTLY. THE METER, TEST STRIPS, AND CONTROL SOLUTION WERE REPLACED. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE PT ALLEGED THAT THE METER WAS READING INACCURATELY, OBTAINED AN ELEVATED METER RESULT, TOOK INSULIN, DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS SUGGESTIVE OF HYPOGLYCEMIA, AND THEN PASSED OUT.",

THEY WENT TO THE BANK AND RETURNED HOME AROUND 10 AM. THEY OBTAINED A 375 MG/DL AT 10:30 AM AND ADMINISTERED 5 UNITS OF HUMALOG. THEY CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD NO SYMPTOMS PRIOR TO TAKING INSULIN. PT TAKES 40 UNITS OF LANTUS AT BEDTIME AND 5 UNITS OF HUMALOG DURING THE DAYTIME IF THEIR BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IS ABOVE 300 MG/DL. WITHIN 1/2 HOUR ON THE INSULIN INJECTION THEY STARTED FEELING SLEEPY. THEY DECIDED TO TAKE A SHORT NAP INSTEAD OF EATING LUNCH. THEIR FAMILY MEMBER NOTICED THAT THEY DID \"NOT LOOK RIGHT\" AND DECIDED TO GET HELP FROM THE APARTMENT MANAGER. THE MANAGER CONTACTED 911 AND WITHIN MINUTES THE EMS ARRIVED. THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS NOT BREATHING CORRECT, UNCONSCIOUS AND UNABLE TO RESPOND TO THE EMS. A RESULT BELOW 26 MG/DL WAS OBTAINED ON THE EMS METER. THEY WERE ADMINISTERED \"SUGAR WATER\" AND TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSP. SINCE THEY REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS ON THE WAY TO THE HOSP, THEY WERE GIVEN A SANDWICH, JUICE MILK, ICE CREAM, AND JELLO AT THE ER. THEY WERE RELEASED 4 1/2 HOURS LATER WITH A BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL BETWEEN 300 MG/DL AND 400 MG/DL. THE PT IS ON MEDICATION FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT VERIFIED THAT THE PT WAS USING CORRECT TESTING TECHNIQUES AND HAD TEST STRIPS, WHICH WERE IN GOOD CONDITION. THE CSA WAS UNABLE TO WALK THE PT THROUGH QUALITY CONTROL TESTING, AS THE CONTROL SOLUTION HAD EXPIRED. THE METER, TEST STRIPS, AND CONTROL SOLUTION WERE REPLACED. THE PT OBTAINED A 375 MG/DL, WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH BLOOD GLUCOSE, TAKE INSULIN BASED ON THE RESULTS, LOST CONSCIOUSNESS, AND RECEIVED TREATMENT OF HYPOGLYCEMIA. THE READING DID NOT MATCH THE PT'S STATE. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THIS WAS DUE TO A MALFUNCTION OR USER ERROR.

## Charlotte01: Mother hallucinating after medication change *

Charlotte's mother had ALS condition and went to specialist who stopped a couple medicines and changed her to another. After taking the new medication, her mother started hallucinating. She was seeing cats and swatting at things with an arm she hadn't used in 3 years. Charlotte's sister was there and asked the doctor what's going on. "It's the part of her condition" he said. There was 30h of this. 

Charlotte's sister didn't have a computer so she faxed the list of medications to Charlotte and she tracked down a state agency pharmacist. He searched online and found that stopping her old medications causes hallucinations. He told them to have her give half doses of one of the old medicines. She was fine and able to sleep. 

## Charlotte02: Self-prescribed Ritalin

Charlotte's friend couldn't focus and concentrate. Her friend self-diagnosed herself as ADD. She convinced a psychologist in town to write her a Ritalin prescription. The friend took it and started acting weird. Sitting up in bed in the middle of the night. She couldn't sleep or eat right. Everyone around her saw issue. Convinced her to see physician. Took to local detox. 

## Charlotte03: After Blue Bell recall, wondered about safety of ice machine

In the Blue Bell incident, news said it was some cold-loving bacteria in the machines. Sandy is responsible for facilities and wondered about the ice machine. Could it be a problem? Do we need to clean it? What to know what are the conditions to create that problem (in other things). Mold in crevices? They notice mold in ice machine. Is this a problem?

## Sandy01: Lookup parent's medicine *

Parents are remote and call to tell Sandy that "the doctor prescribed me this." They don't remember the condition. Just medicine. They read the label to Sandy. Sandy wonders "What condition do they actual have?" Sandy googles the medicine name to see 1) conditions associated with it, 2) label information, 3) side-effects, 4) how safe it is (low adverse effects rating/chart).

## Sandy02: WebMD is a top hit

9 out of 10 items it seems, she's directed to WebMD. It's SEO: "Treatment for {condition}. {drug}" Sometimes Wikipedia.

Sandy's doctor prescribed her Hydroquinone. Sandy thought nothing of it and started using it. Randomly, another friend talked about risks and said "at least you're not using Hydroquinone." "But I am!" 
Her friend told her it was controversial. Sandy googled it and discovered it was 1) banned in France and 2) gave rats liver damage. Seeing "liver damage" in print made an impact. (More than hearing it described in commercial disclaimer.) Sandy wondered who is right? France? US? Later, a second doctor reassured her that it wasn't dangerous. "I use it. My kids use it." Sandy ended up using it then.

## Sandy06: Curious about past recall *

Show where certain drug is on that same curve. Show trending drugs, food and devices that people might be worried about.

## Sandy09: Lookup Steroids treatment for Eczema *

**[Placeholder for URL]** - note: The Quoter shall send the Government a URL representing the repository and if more than one branch is present, then the quoter must note the specific branch that should be evaluated. The timestamp of the most recent commit on the branch in the canonical repository to be evaluated will be the source that determines the Timeliness of Prototype Delivery.
* Must not get any HTTP 4xx or 5xx errors.

Write a brief description, no greater than 750 words, of the approach used to create the prototype.

###"Executive Summary" - (100 words)
* Introduction to SRA and who we are
* Brief statement of understanding of 18F ethos and mission
* Brief statement of understanding of the problem/data set

###Our Full Stack Approach - (600 words)
* User-driven design - "Put the needs of the users first."
  * Ideation - opportunity canvas
  * User identification & interviews
  * User research and analysis - persona development
  * Idea solidification - story map development
* Set up environment to allow for frequent, interative release cycle, maximize feedback cycles - "Release early, iteratively, and often"
  * Set team cadance - 3 stand-ups, early retrospective, timeboxed MVP milestone
  * Set team expectations, define roles/responsibilities early - select leaders for Design & Development, empower one Product Owner/Manager
  * Collocate, but also accomodate remote members - Slack, GitHub, Waffle.io, Google Docs, conference calls, WebEx
* Build in quality - "Don't slow down delivery"
  * Build in quality from the start - user stories, lightweight business cases, acceptance criteria
  * Test throughout - unit tests, automated acceptance tests, user validation
  * Peer review to ensure continuity - pair programming, code review
* Maximize value delivery - "Only do it if it adds value"
  * Use light-weight WSJF by sizing job size vs. business value and delivering most value with least work
  * Build in security - XSS, CSRF
  * Build with NFRs in mind - "future-proof" - can always grow later
  * Only produce minimal, useful documentation
  * Use existing code whenever possible (open-source) instead of building from scratch
* Be transparent - "Work in the open"
  * Work off the backlog - pull system that reflects whole process
  * Code Standards - Definition of Done, style guide
  * Conversations always better than documentation

###Conclusion (50 words)
* Our approach and mindset line up with 18F's key principles and will results in a strong partnership

### Use Case Hypotheses by User Type
##### Patient
* I was just diagnosed and have several medication options for treatment
* I am on several medications for ongoing clinical depression
* I think I’m experiencing some side effects with my but want to learn more before talking with my doctor about them
* I heard something on twitter about a potential recall and I want to learn more

##### Caregiver
* I’m taking care of my aging parent who is taking several medications
* My child has severe allergies and I need to know about everything 
* I’m getting my child vaccinated

##### Physician
* My patients seem to be complaining about a side effect of their medication but I’m not sure if this is just a coincidence, or if other patients are experiencing the same thing.
* I want to make sure I have the most up-to-date, accurate information to tell my patients about medications and medical devices.

##### Hospital/Healthcare System/Medical or Nursing School
* I want to know the overall risk profile of a drug or medical device so we can train our care providers with the most up-to-date information.
* I want to improve our education and training program.

##### Researcher
* I want to test a hypothesis around adverse events for drug options for a particular condition. 
* I want to further research about what types of drugs and devices have a higher risk to harm patients.

##### Businesses partners that want to meet consumer needs:
* I’m a community platform (patientslikeme) and want to create a 2-way street where our online community provides the FDA with adverse event information and we are able to surface that information back to the community population.

* I’m a large pharmacy (Walgreens) and want to create a platform for our consumers to search for medication-related information.

* I’m a food app (Edibly) and want to help my users to see the inactive ingredients in mediations easily.

* I’m a decision support tool (WebMD) and want to add a layer of information to help our customers make decisions around drugs and medical devices.

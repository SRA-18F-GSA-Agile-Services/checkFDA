### Challenge to Solve For
#####Our challenge is to....
**1) Create one place for consumers to search on FDA drug, medical device, or food information that visualizes fast answers to questions and decrease anxiety that they are not getting the correct, full picture.**
* _Winner: We deliver visualization, actual data in a digestible format that is more customized._

2) Help patients who think they are having an adverse event to a medication but are not sure, find out through a guided online experience.
* _Cut: Can roll into challenge 1._ 

3) Help patients and caretakers learn about potential drugs and medical device options and their risk profiles for a specific condition, so that they can make the best medical decisions and prepare to talk with physicians. 
* _Cut: Can roll into challenge 1._  

4) Create an open platform that communicates information relating to adverse events but also facilitates patients reporting this information in near real-time so the system continues to grow in relevance over time.
* _Cut: Definitely beneficial for users to input data into the system but don’t want to replicate data. Set of data that FDA isn’t already tracking._ 

5) Create a platform communicating adverse events that is easily connected to partner outlets like WebMD, patientslikeme, Walgreens or patient advocacy groups so that the information reaches a mass audience.
* _Cut: Cut because it is difficult to prove this one. Could be part of the story but not something we build this week._ 

6) Create a platform for researchers to easily query the data and receive easily consumable interpretations so they can test hypotheses and use results for research papers.
* _Cut: Researchers are lower on priority list than general public._ 

### Vision 
**1) Create one place for consumers to search on FDA drug, medical device, or food information that visualizes fast answers to questions and decrease anxiety that they are not getting the correct, full picture.**

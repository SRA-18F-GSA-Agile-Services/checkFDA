### Consumer-Related Concept Ideas

##### 1. FDA Snapshot Standard
Standardized drug or device web 'cards', like food label that is easily recognizable and surfaced in places like google searches.
* _Consumer Value_: Quick, glance-able overview of what they are looking for where they are searching.
* _Business Value_: Create a branded visual that promotes trust and links to openFDA, driving traffic.

##### 2. Trend Board
Show trending food, drugs people are worried about, including historical information. Potential to sign up for alerts to push trends or recalls direct to people.
* _Consumer Value_: Stay in the know about recent events.
* _Business Value_: Be the source of up-to-date information. Change perception of FDA to that of current, on-trend.

##### 3. Search Box
Visualize search results across food, drug and device. Include results by condition or symptom like fatigue because these are highly searched by users.
* _Consumer Value_: See the full picture from trusted source. Not only answer the question they've asked but allows them to find answers to other questions they're interested in.
* _Business Value_: Provide analytics about searches and search locations that occur so they can better address what data they can store or get information on searches that they haven't done FDA reports for yet.

##### 4. Feed Data to FDA
Make it easier for people to submit adverse events, either on the site or on mobile phones to capture events in real time as they are happening. PatientsLikeMe online patient network partnered with the FDA on Monday for research collaboration to ‘determine how patient-reported data can give new insight into drug safety’ and feed  
* _Consumer Value_: If more consumers are reporting adverse events more often, the data set becomes more robust, real time, and useful for the consumers themselves- creating a 'snowball effect.' The more consumers give the more they get back.
* _Business Value_: Receive more data at a faster pace, that is more immediate or 'real-time' to the person experience the adverse event.

##### 5. Connect to 3rd Parties
Display standardized FDA treatment web cards in consumer decision support places like WebMD, PatientsLikeMe, Epocrates and PocketPharmacist. 
* Ingredient Food Apps like Edibly can show FDA recalls, drug interactions, and drug  to consumers when they scan the barcode of a product.
* Pharmacy Websites like Walgreens show customers the most common adverse events or the ingredients of a drug.  In February, Walgreens partnered with PatientsLikeMe to gather information about medication side effects and post it on walgreens.com.
* Collaborative Care applications like Patient IO capture patient adverse effects straight to FDA to drive input data as well.

* _Consumer Value_: Help consumers with decision-making for different drugs and medical devices. Help consumers prepare to communicate with physicians about different drug and medical device options based on adverse events and recall information. Consumers can find the trusted source for inactive ingredients, routes of administration, and drug interactions of medications where they are already searching. 
* _Business Value_: Educate the public at a large scale (Walgreens has 8 million customers).

### Non-Consumer Concept Ideas (De-Prioritized for Hackathon)

##### 1. Health Plans and Payers
Health Plans like Aetna, Humana, or Kaiser Permanente use OpenFDA Data to analyze risk factors of medical devices or drugs to inform their pricing negotiations with drug and device manufacturers.
* _Value_: Improve preparedness and negotiation platform when talking with drug and medical device companies.

##### 2. Health Research Institutes & Academics
The Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic uses OpenFDA data to perform academic research around a hypothesis for drug or device adverse effects. 
* _Value_: Further research about what types of drugs and devices are syncing with consumer lives and which ones have a higher risk to harm.

##### 3. Hospitals, Healthcare Systems & Medical Schools
Healthcare Systems like Beth Israel Deaconess, Mt. Sinai, or the VA tap into OpenFDA data to analyze risk factors of medical devices or drugs for educating care providers about relevant trends in drugs and devices. 
* _Value_: Improve education of doctors, nurses, and pharmacists.

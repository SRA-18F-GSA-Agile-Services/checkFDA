### Team Prep
##### General Concept
* Set up context
* Give control to user for search and results
* Stop at every screen to ask questions about their experience, (how does this compare/contrast to their current process) and get their reactions about the screen.

##### Scenario 1
* Answers Use Case: ‘Is this symptom related to the drug?’ 

##### Scenario 2
* Answers Use Case: ‘Does this recall affect me?’ 

##### Scenario 3
* Answers Use Case: ‘What is the risk profile of this drug?’ 

##### Scenario 4
* Answers Use Case: ‘What are drug-on-drug interactions?’

### Discussion Guide
##### Setup 

Welcome. Today we’re going to show you some screens and be asking you some questions to get your feedback on what will make the best experience for searching FDA information about drugs, devices, and food.

##### If recording for WebEx:
We would like to record our discussion today, both audio and screen capture on the WebEx to ensure that we capture your thoughts and opinions accurately. The data will never be used for public purposes. Is it OK for us to record the session today?

We are looking for your open and honest feedback. Please talk aloud and describe your reactions to what you see. Your opinions are very valuable to us and we want you to know that there are no right or wrong answers during this conversation. 

##### Concept Validation
For the next part of the conversation, we’re going to walk through some concepts we created for searching the FDA’s open information. I will share my screen so you can see the same thing I am seeing. 
_We need your feedback to help us understand how we could make this a useful search tool for you._

##### Concept Overview
###### Search Box
Here you can see an open search box on the FDA site called CheckFDA. You can use this search box just like Google to type in anything you would like to know about regulated drugs (pharmaceutical and over the counter), medical devices, and food.  

##### Scenarios
See interviewer questions below all scenarios.

###### Scenario 1 
Now let’s imagine that you are the adult child of an aging mother who has Alzheimer's disease. Your mother recently stopped taking medications Namenda and Exelon and changed to another called Aricept with generic name Donepezil. After a couple days, your mother complains to you of hallucinations and she starts to act strangely like swatting at the air. You are very concerned, but the doctor says this behavior is part of her condition. However, you think it could possibly be due to her new medication routine.

###### Scenario 2
In this next scenario, you have just returned from a camping trip when you read online a story about a recall of Sabra hummus in your area. You remember that you and your friends were eating Sabra over the weekend. You want to know more details about the food recall.

###### Scenario 3
In a third scenario you are the parent of a 6-year-old son with severe Eczema. The doctor has prescribed a steroid topical medicine Elidel, but hasn’t provided much other information. You think steroids might be too severe, and you’re concerned about how or if to use it. 

###### Scenario 4
Your significant other has just been diagnosed with cancer and prescribed 2 different, complicated medications called Adrucil and Cytoxan. You want to learn more, including if there are any interactions between the drugs.

##### Questions for All Scenarios
###### Input Questions:
* What would you type into the search box?
* Why?

###### Return Questions
* Describe what you see here.
* What are your reactions?
* What else would you expect to see?
* What is helpful about this view?
* How could we make the information more understandable?
* How could we make the information more useful?
* What would you do next?
* What would you click on to learn more?
* How might you refine your search to get the information you’re looking for?


### Additional Use Cases to Test

##### Scenario 5
* Answers Use Case: ‘What is typical treatment for people like me?’ 

##### Scenario 6
* Answers Use Case: ‘Is there a generic?’

##### Scenario 7
* Answers Use Case: ‘Is this medical device safe to use?’ 

###### Scenario 5
You have been on and off different medications for depression for the past several year and as a result have experienced a 'rollercoaster' of related side effects, including most recently, Paxil. Your doctor has recommended a new medication Celexa, but you are wondering if this treatment is typical for people like you. You also want to know what types of reactions they have experienced so you can compare medications and make an informed decision for switching treatments.

###### Scenario 6
You've been taking the medication Paxil take medication regularly and want the cheapest version. Target supplied the medicine cheaply, but then stopped carrying it. You wonder about another source, perhaps a generic alternative. You want want to find out if there is a generic and if they are really the same in terms of effectiveness and side effects.

###### Scenario 7
Your 12-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes. She has been using a Medtronic blood glucose pump system called MiniMed 530G. However, you recently heard about DexCom's continuous glucose monitoring system called Dexcom G4 Platinum. This system enables you to track your daughter's blood glucose levels through a Dexcom Share app on your phone. You are seriously considering making a switch because of this feature, but want to do some more research before talking with your daughter's physician.
